# Pete — History

## Project Context

**Project:** RadiusClaim — .NET reference application demonstrating portable distributed systems using Dapr (app-layer building blocks) and Radius (infrastructure abstraction).

**Stack:** .NET 9, Dapr, Radius 0.55.0, AKS, Azure (Storage, Service Bus, Key Vault), Bicep, bash scripts.

**User:** Wesley Backelant

**Team root:** `/Users/wesleyb/git/RadiusClaim`

## Key Files (Pete's Domain)

- `scripts/bootstrap.sh` — main deployment orchestration (rad credential register → rad env update → rad deploy env → rad deploy app → pull secret)
- `scripts/teardown.sh` — resource cleanup (known bug: AKS skipped then deleted anyway via resource group sweep — fix in progress)
- `scripts/prepare-cluster.sh` — pre-cluster setup (AKS, kubeconfig, Radius workspace, SPN with `--create-spn` flag)
- `scripts/deploy-dapr-components.sh` — original Dapr component deployment (SP-based, deprecated)
- `scripts/deploy-dapr-components-workload-identity.sh` — workload identity version (current canonical)

## Current Cluster State (as of joining)

- **AKS:** `radiusclaim-aks` in `radiusclaim-rg`
- **Namespace:** `azure-radiusclaim`
- **Managed identity:** `radiusclaim-workload-identity` (client ID: `061dd532-71c6-40ac-9a90-750a1a868001`)
- **OIDC + Workload Identity:** enabled on AKS
- **Federated credentials:** expense-api, workflow-engine, notification-svc
- **Dapr components:** statestore (Blob, WI), pubsub (Service Bus, WI in progress), platform-secrets (Key Vault, WI)
- **Gateway:** `http://expense.radiusclaim.9.160.144.105.nip.io`

## Known Issues on Hire

- `teardown.sh` bug: `--aks-cluster` not provided → script says "skipping AKS" but deletes it anyway via resource group sweep. Graham is fixing this (agent: graham-teardown-fix).
- pubsub Service Bus still on SAS (workload identity migration in progress via graham-servicebus-wi agent).

## Learnings

### 2026-03-27: Zero-Secret Dapr Milestone Complete (Scribe)

**Update from Scribe execution of graham-servicebus-wi spawn manifest:**

Service Bus pubsub component has been migrated from SAS connection string to Azure Workload Identity, completing the zero-secret achievement for all Dapr components. The deployment script `deploy-dapr-components-workload-identity.sh` is now the canonical version for cluster deployments and includes:

- Service Bus RBAC grant (Azure Service Bus Data Owner role)
- Workload identity component manifest generation for all 3 Dapr components
- No secret creation in workload identity mode
- Clear verification steps for operators

When the cluster is next recreated, all Dapr components will authenticate via Azure AD federated tokens — zero shared secrets in the cluster.
